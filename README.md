# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

* Description of the project:

This is the first step towards building the web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because I will use what I build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

* Description of the command interpreter:
A command interpreter, or shell, executes user-entered commands, facilitating interactions with the operating system. Users open a terminal or command prompt to access it. Commands like ls (list files) and cd (change directory) are common. To learn commands, users can use --help, man <command> (Unix-like), or <command> /? (Windows). The interpreter enables tasks such as running programs, managing files, and configuring settings. It's a powerful tool for efficiently interacting with the operating system.
